Team Escalation

Build a web page that allows you to assemble a team of players. It should be possible to:

- Pick a player
    - Inform the position of the player to be selected for the team.
    - Enter the player's name.
    - Enter the player's shirt number.
    - Having a “Select” button that asks the user if they want to confirm that player's lineup and then enters the information in a list on the page.
    - After the player is cast the text fields must be cleared.

-Remove a player
    - Enter the player's shirt number.
    - Having a “Remove” button that asks the user if he wants to confirm the removal of that player and then deletes him from the list on the page.
    - After the player is removed the text field must be cleared.
